          <strong>Jane Austen</strong> was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which
          interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots
          often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic
          security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of
          the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and
          social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.
          <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
          While Austen received some accolades for her works while still alive, with her first three novels garnering
          critical attention and increasing financial reward, it was not until after her death that her brother Henry
          revealed to the public that she was an author.
          <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
          A significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in
          Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set. They
          gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's
          publication of <em>A Memoir of Jane Austen</em> introduced a compelling version of her writing career and
          supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.

        <p>
          Jane Austen was born in the Hampshire village of Steventon, where her father, the Reverend George Austen, was
          rector. She was the second daughter and seventh child in a family of eight—six boys and two girls. Her closest
          companion throughout her life was her elder sister, Cassandra; neither Jane nor Cassandra married. Their
          father was a scholar who encouraged the love of learning in his children. His wife, Cassandra (née Leigh), was
          a woman of ready wit, famed for her impromptu verses and stories. The great family amusement was acting.
          <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. Her artistic
          apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she
          experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and
          wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth.
          <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Jane Austen’s lively and affectionate family circle provided a stimulating context for her writing. Moreover,
          her experience was carried far beyond Steventon rectory by an extensive network of relationships by blood and
          friendship. It was this world — of the minor landed gentry and the country clergy, in the village, the
          neighbourhood, and the country town, with occasional visits to Bath and to London — that she was to use in the
          settings, characters, and subject matter of her novels.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Death</h2>
        <p>
          In 1816, at the age of 41, Austen started to become ill with what some say might have been Addison's disease.
          She made impressive efforts to continue working at a normal pace, editing older works as well as starting a
          new novel. At some point, Austen's condition deteriorated to such a degree that she ceased writing. She died
          on July 18, 1817, in Winchester, Hampshire, England.
